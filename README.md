# De-Noising_Autoencoder
Random Noise removed from the image, It can be used to enhance CCTV or photographs having noise.
ISO Noise can also be tried with this.
They were invented to help
1. Hidden layer to learn more robust features
2. Reduce risk of overfitting in autoencoder
3. Prevent autoencoder to learn a simple identity function (that would make it just repeat what is entered into the input)

## Features of AutoEncoder
1. Denoise the image using DeepLearning
2. Anomaly Detection with Keras, Tensorflow, Deep Learning
3. Compressing the image to a latent space
